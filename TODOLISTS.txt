### Fri Sep 9th 2022 : 
- Use testing tools googletest and mocking tools from googletest
- Use bazel for build tool rather than cmake
- Translate all python to C++ efficiently

- BUG : conversion.py and conversion.hpp need to fix the quadrants checking when converting back both from rotation matrix and quaternion to euler angles

### Thu Sep 15th 2022 :
- Will use googletest
- Built with Bazel
- Translated all files to c++
- I have to write SE3 stuff in python first I guess, maybe even finishing the metrics thing as well.
